# RunParameters - Query/Run Configuration

The `RunParameters` class contains a set of parameters that configure the query and run details for the Correlation Detective algorithm. 
These parameters allow you to customize the behavior of the algorithm to suit your specific needs.
We refer to our [paper](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1266-papapetrou.pdf) for more details about the parameters and their effects on the algorithm.
